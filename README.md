# what-hell
just try
maybe it's a chance or not
but i'm going to be a better me
I belived in you
you can do everything
nothing can fetter you
your free soul
love u
hope u approch dreams that u will die for it
I know it's hard
but before whatever u get u should pay first
the most luxurious thing is not the waste of money
it's the waste of life
take your time
